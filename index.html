      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a first-year student at SRMIST, curious about learning and building new things.
    I recently joined the Founder’s Club as a member to explore innovation and teamwork.
    I am currently developing my skills in web development and creative design.
    I believe learning is a journey best taken with consistency and curiosity.
    This page is a small reflection of my interests and growth so far.
